This Python code is a Battery Management System (BMS) application for analyzing LiFePO4 cells. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5 library for real-time monitoring and recording of various parameters such as cell voltage, temperature, state of charge (SOC), and charging/discharging status. The application also includes a battery design visualization using QGraphicsView. Key features of the application include:
USE CASES AND FEATURES:
Real-time monitoring and display of cell voltage, temperature, SOC, and charging/discharging status.
Visualization of battery design with graphical representation of lithium-ion ions.
Graphical representation of voltage-time and voltage-SOC relationships.
Recording functionality to save sensor data to a CSV file.
User-friendly interface with options to start/stop recording, update available COM ports, and clear the graph.
Integration with Arduino via serial communication for data acquisition.
The application provides a comprehensive tool for monitoring and analyzing LiFePO4 battery cells, making it suitable for research, testing, and development purposes.
